## Usage

After installation updates are applied sequentially based on commit hierarchy.
In normal development flow this won't be a problem. However, If you attempt to
reset or checkout an older commit it won't work because Discourse will presume
that the commit is already there and not provide you the opportunity to update.
To do so you must move forward in the history (perhaps in the worse case using
an `--allow-empty` commit).

### Production

For the initial install login to Discourse as an admin and navigate to the Admin
menu then the Customize section. There is an **Import** button. When you click
on it a modal popup will ask for **From the web** when selected enter the
following URL:

    https://github.com/C-S-D/pph-theme.git

From here you can set the **CSD Public Policy Hub** theme as the default for
the site.

As there are changes to this repository those changes can be reflected by
clicking that theme in the **Admin | Customize | Themes** section and then in
the **Custom CSS/HTML** section there is a button labeled **Check for Updates**.

Discourse does not subscribe to any branch which means it defaults to the main
one provided by GitHub (in this case `master`).

### Development

In development you can use the same steps as above but instead of pointing to
GitHub you can point to your local git repo. To do so you will have to start a
Git daemon. While *in this repo* run the following command:

```console
$ git daemon --verbose --export-all --base-path=. --reuseaddr ./.git
```

This will provide you an import URL of:

| Running Locally        | Running in Vagrant    |
|------------------------|-----------------------|
| `git://127.0.0.1/.git` | `git://10.0.2.2/.git` |

You only need this running at the time you click the **Check for Updates**
button. When using the Git Daemon, Discourse will presume the latest is based on
the current branch that is checked out when the daemon is started. This means
updates can happen as long as they follow the sequential caveat described above.

A good workflow in development is to make a WIP commit each time you want to
check the changes and continue to sequentially make more as you develop. Then
when satisfied rebase the branch back into well formed commits then push that
for PR.
